"""
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. 
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

Example:
N = 4
append 1
append 2
insert 1 3
print
- append 1: Append 1 to the list arr = [1].
- append 2: Append 2 to the list, arr = [1, 2].
- insert 1 3: Insert 3 at index 1, arr = [1, 3, 2].
- print: Print the array.

Output: [1, 3, 2]

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of commands.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains one of the commandds described above.

Constraints
- The elements addded to the list must be integers.

Output Format
For each command of type [print], print the list on a new line.

Sample Input 0:
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print

Sample Output 0
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
